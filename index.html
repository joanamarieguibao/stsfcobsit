                    Facebook is one of the most popular social media platforms today.
                    It provides a space for individuals and communities to promote their products easily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Indigenous products such as hand-crafted items, traditional handwoven textiles, locally sourced food, and artisanal goods are not just commodities to purchase.
                    But they represent cultural expression, tradition, and creativity. Products each entail cultural storytelling, represented from practices unique to the indigenous community, capturing the heritage/skill as well as the value of the community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Indigenous artisans create Facebook pages to relate to consumers and promote their goods inexpensively while sharing their stories.
                    It provides cultural heritage preservation and livelihood creation. By enhancing accessibility to Indigenous crafted goods, it encourages a greater appreciation of artisanship and cultural preservation in the 21st century.

                <p>Indigenous communities in the Philippines used to barter locally for handmade, artisan goods like woven textiles, beadwork and pottery.
                   These crafts were a way to remember their cultural practices, rituals, and essential forms of cultural identity.</p>
                <p>While colonization introduced foreign products, Indigenous crafts retained meaning as communities practiced and saved their handmade talents. 
                   Later in the 20th century, governments and cultural festivals promoted the revival of Indigenous industries and crafts.</p>
                <p>Currently, Facebook Pages facilitate the promotion of Indigenous products, allowing artisans to reach national and global markets with "photos" of their products, "video", and stories of those who invested handmade arts and crafts with their practices and rituals, and through their local communities.
                   The resurgence of Indigenous industries and products is reflective of the convergence between tradition and technology that is rediscovering Indigenous ways of knowing and maintenance of culture and livelihoods through social media.</p>

            <h4>Case Study 1:</h4>
            <h2>Abra Indigo – Hand-woven Products by the Itneg Community (Abra, Philippines)</h2>
            <p>Abra Indigo is a social enterprise in partnership with the Itneg weavers of Abra and founded by Ysabelle Sarayba. The Abra-based company handcrafts fabrics, fashion accessories, and home décor.
               During the pandemic, this brand used Facebook Pages among other social media to sell unique face masks that Itneg had woven from excess fabric.</p>
            <p>Abra Indigo spoke of the rich culture and crafts of the Itneg through engaging storytelling and visually appealing posts, thereby creating sustainable income for the weavers.
               In this way, it could reach out to customers from across the country and raise further awareness of how to support indigenous artisans.</p>
            <p>Key Learnings:</p>
            <p>Each weave had some story associated with it, and that was elaborated through Facebook; it connected buyers emotionally to the weave.
               Social media has made indigenous products visible beyond the local market. It underlined the authenticity and rootedness in culture, which served to increase the level of trust and appreciation for local craftsmanship.</p>
